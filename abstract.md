This thesis surveys pre-trained machine learning models and MLOps practices to support the FARM-TECH project, a collaborative research effort to enable monitoring, analysis, and forecasting from sensor and drone data in precision farming. We compiled and reviewed ~100 publicly available models, applying two selection criteria—adequate documentation and domain relevance—to produce a curated set of 15 “relevant” models and a complementary list of non-relevant or poorly documented candidates. The resulting models focus on two application families: multivariate time-series forecasting (sensor, weather, and yield prediction) and computer-vision for plant detection and disease classification (drone and close-range imagery). Key technical findings include: (1) foundation time-series models (e.g., IBM Granite TinyTimeMixers, FlowState, PatchTST variants) provide strong baselines for forecasting and support zero-/few-shot adaptation or fine-tuning for target sampling rates and resolutions; (2) compact architectures (e.g., TSPulse) are attractive for on-device anomaly detection due to low parameter counts and GPU-free inference; and (3) vision models (ViT-based and YOLO-family detectors) achieve high accuracy but may require domain-specific fine-tuning to generalize across crops and imaging conditions. The deliverables include a searchable model inventory, implementation notes for candidate models, and actionable guidance to accelerate deployment of robust, efficient ML services in smart farming contexts.
